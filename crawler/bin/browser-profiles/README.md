# Browser Profiles

This directory includes a collection of zip-packaged firefox profiles. 

The different crawls supported by this project each require a specific browser configuration which includes browser settings, installed extensions and extension settings.

While playwright does offer the possibility to manage settings and extensions via its interfaces, this does not include all required features for our crawls. Because of that, it is required to se pre-defined browser profiles.
